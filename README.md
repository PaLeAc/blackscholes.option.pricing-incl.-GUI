This is my first project in financial modeling, created as an introduction to quantitative finance concepts. This Python GUI application, built with Tkinter, calculates European call and put option prices using the Black-Scholes formula. The interface allows users to enter option parameters (spot price, strike price, time to maturity, risk-free rate, and volatility) and view calculated prices for both call and put options.

The application also includes a basic heatmap feature to visualize how option prices vary with changes in spot price and volatility. Tooltips provide specific parameter details for each calculation, making it easy to track inputs and results.

Features
Black-Scholes Calculation: Calculate call and put prices for European options.
Heatmap Visualization: View option price variations with respect to spot price and volatility.
Beginner-Friendly Interface: A simple setup to explore option pricing fundamentals and build financial modeling skills.
